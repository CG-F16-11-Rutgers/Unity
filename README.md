B1: 
In this assignment, we had to create a simple crowd simulator.
The requirements that we had to meet were:
- Creating a free look camera
- Creating a complex environment
- A NavMesh for the whole environment
- Agent prefab with NavMeshAgent component
- Agent Navigation with a mouse
- A NavMeshObstacle which could move when selected
- Refine agent navigation (collision with each other)
- Dynamic obstacles
- Different weight Planes
Although there were a few small bugs in our assignments, we were able to meet most of these requirements. 
The only problem with our project was that we were unable to finish creating dynamic obstacles.
This was due to the communication problems we had in our group.
